Hi {{user.get_full_name}}!

Please note that your Vumi Go account ({{account.user.email}}) has reached {{threshold_percent}}% used of the total available credits. Your remaining balance is {{credit_balance}} credits.

You will no longer be able to send messages. Contacts on campaigns over USSD or Voice will receive a notification saying that your account has run out of credits. All incoming messages will be received as normal.

To top up your credits contact your Praekelt programme manager with the number of messages/sessions you want loaded. Once you have loaded enough credits, all messages will be sent and received as normal.


Regards,

The Vumi Go Team.
