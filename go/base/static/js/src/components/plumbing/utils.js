    // element's dimensions changed). Its fair to expect a manual offset
    // recalculation and repaint in these situtations, but
    // .recalculateOffsets() (the method exposed by jsPlumb for this) doesn't
    // appear to help. To solve this, we instead use jquery ui's .draggable()

    // (internal?) method which seems to be used internally by
    // jsPlumb.repaintEverything()) and .repaint(). jsPlumb appears to still
    // manage draggables and calculate offsets even when jsPlumb.draggable()

    // calculating offsets, we remove the element from the state jsPlumb keeps
    // to manage draggables.
